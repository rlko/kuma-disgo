## Features

- Real-time service status monitoring from Uptime Kuma's API
- Minimal and detailed view options
- Automatic status updates

## Building

The project uses a Makefile for building and packaging:

make build COMPRESS=1

# Create a Debian package
make deb

The binary will be created in the project directory, while packages and archives will be placed in the `build` directory.
